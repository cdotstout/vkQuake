# Building on Android

## Prerequisites

- [Android NDK r11b](http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html) (or newer) - Somewhere in your search path
- vkQuake is built against API level 23 (requires the SDK Platform installed)
- Python (Used for the build files)

## A note on SDL2
Even though the Android port uses the native app glue for input and asset management it stell needs SDL2 to compile. 
The repository contains a prebuild `libSDL2.a` static library for `arm-v7`. If you need this for a different platform or want to update, run the `buildstatic.py` script from the `jni/SDL2` subfolder. 

## PAK files
`.pak` are loaded as assets stored in the `vkQuake.apk`. So **before building** they have to be put into the `assets/id1` folder so they get packaged during the build process.

## Config files
Config files will also be loaded from the apk as assets. The asset folder includes a default `config.cfg` for gamepad usage. If you need to change config values, edit the file in `assets/id1` before building  

## Device support
- **To run these examples you need a device with an Android image that suports Vulkan**
- Builds currently only support `arm-v7`, x86 may follow at a later point
- Android TV leanback launcher is supported
- Gamepad support
    - Left stick: Move
    - Right stick: Aim
    - X: Fire
    - A: Jump
    - B: Menu
    - Y: Console
    - L1/R1: Switch weapon 

## Missing stuff
- Sound
- Keyboard input
- Touch input
- Multiplayer
- Saving/loading games and config 

## Building

### Prepare SDK

```
setup.py
```

Will prepare the build for API level 23, generating a few files required for the build process.

### Build (and deploy)

```
build.py (-deploy)
```

If successful, the build process will output the `vkQuake.apk` to the Android directory.

Use the "deploy" switch (if a device is connected) to install the apk after the build.
